\section{Tikz commands, options, and keys}
"pgfplots" is built on top of Tikz, which has hundreds of commands for
drawing things, and you can combine Tikz commands with "pgfplots" commands.
\begin{latex}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
      axis lines=middle,
      clip=false,ymax=20,
      restrict y to domain=0:20
      ]
    \addplot[smooth,very thick,blue]{-x^2+15};
"    \draw[red,thick] (0,15) circle (0.6cm);
    \draw[red,thick,->] (2,18) node[above right]{Wow!} -- (0.75,16.5);"
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{latex}
%
\begin{center}
\tikzcount
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
      axis lines=middle,
      clip=false,ymax=20,
      restrict y to domain=0:20
      ]
    \addplot[smooth,very thick,blue]{-x^2+15};

    \draw[red,thick] (0,15) circle (0.6cm);
    \draw[red,thick,->] (2,18) node[above right]{Wow!} -- (0.75,16.5);
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
You can include any Tikz commands within the "axis" environment, and
the coordinates used in that command will equal the numbers that
"axis" is using.  In the example above, the circle is centered at the
\emph{logical coordinate} (0,~15) where the 0 and 15 equal the numbers
shown in the axes.  Perhaps it seems obvious that it would work this
way, but note: (1) There is a lot of scaling going on to turn the 15
on the $y$-axis above into an actual distance on the paper that is
closer to 5cm.  (2) The numbers do \emph{not} match up that way if you
put that same "\draw" command outside of "axis".  (3) The numbers do
\emph{not} match up that way if you put ``cm'' after the coordinates
(which is why we \emph{did} put ``cm'' in the radius for the circle;
this is a radius of a ``real'' 0.5 centimeters, not a radius of 0.5 in
the coordinate system used in the axes.)  See the section on sizing
axes for more about this distinction.

In addition to adding Tikz commands inside of "axis" you can add Tikz
options/keys to the "\addplot" command.  The following might be useful
keys (some we've seen already)
\begin{itemize}
\item colors, for example "blue", "red", etc.  You can enter these
  directly or as "color = blue", etc.

\item line thicknesses: "ultra thin", "very thin", "thin",
  "semithick", "thick", "very thick", "ultra thick", %
"line width = "$\langle\text{\it dimension}\rangle$

\item line styles: "dashed", "dotted" (both also have "loosely" and
  "densely" varieties, like "densely dashed").  You can also create a
  double line with "double"
\begin{latex}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[axis lines = middle]
  \addplot[very thick, "double =black, double distance = 1.5pt", 
       smooth, green, domain=-1.5:0]{x^3-x}; 
  \addplot[very thick, "double =black, double distance = 1.5pt," 
       smooth, red,domain=0:1.5]{x^3-x};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{latex}
%
\begin{center}
\tikzcount
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[axis lines = middle]
  \addplot[very thick, double =black, double distance = 1.5pt, 
       smooth, green, domain=-1.5:0]{x^3-x}; 
  \addplot[very thick, double =black, double distance = 1.5pt, 
       smooth, red,domain=0:1.5]{x^3-x};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}


\item Arrow tips and tails: "<", ">" and "|" can be put at either end, and
  also stacked up:
\begin{latex}
\begin{tikzpicture}[yscale=0.5]
\draw"[->]" (0,0) -- (1,0);
\draw"[<->]" (0,-1) -- (1,-1);
\draw"[>-|]" (0,-2) -- (1,-2);
\draw"[|->>>]" (0,-3) -- (1,-3);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{latex}
%
\begin{center}
\tikzcount
\begin{tikzpicture}[yscale=0.5]
\draw[->] (0,0) -- (1,0);
\draw[<->] (0,-1) -- (1,-1);
\draw[>-|] (0,-2) -- (1,-2);
\draw[|->>>] (0,-3) -- (1,-3);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Note that there are a \emph{huge} number of additional arrow tips and
tails, but for many of these you'll need to load the "arrows.meta" package
in Tikz.

\item Bends: 
\begin{latex}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[axis lines=middle, clip = false]
\addplot[very thick,smooth,blue,domain=0:8]{(x-4)^2};
\draw[->,"out = 225,in=75",very thick] 
      (4,15) node[above right]{Wow!} "to" (0.1,16.1);
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{latex}
%
\begin{center}
\tikzcount
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[axis lines=middle, clip = false]
\addplot[very thick,smooth,blue,domain=0:8]{(x-4)^2};
\draw[->,out = 225,in=75,very thick] 
      (4,15) node[above right]{Wow!} to (0.1,16.1);
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Here "out" refers to what angle the path will make ``coming out'' of a
point (in this case coming out of the point next to ``Wow!''), "in"
refers to what angle the path will make ``coming in'' to a point (in
this case the point $(0,15)$\,), and "to" replaces the more common
"--" so instead of a straight line (which "--" makes), the path ``goes
to'' the given point.


\item plot expression options: Although we use the "\addplot" command,
  which is part of the "pgfplots" package, the main thing it adds
  compared to plain Tikz is automatic scaling of the final picture,
  automatic options for the lines that show the axes, and automatic
  options for tick marks, tick labels, labels, etc.  In particular,
  most of the options we pass to "\addplot" are from Tikz, including
  the following
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemii}{$\circ$}
\item "domain=5:10" will plot a formula using 25 $x$-values
  starting at 5 and finishing at 10.

\item "samples = 100" will change the number of $x$-values
  used in the domain to 100.  

\item "samples at = {5,7,9,15}" will cause the function formula to be
  evaluated at $x=5$, $x=7$, $x=9$ and $x=15$.  It overrides the
  "domain" and "samples" options.

\item "coordinates = {(1,2) (3,4) (10,15)}" will make a plot through
  the points $(1,2)$, $(3,4)$ and $(10,15)$.

\item "only marks" means the plot will not connect points with a line
  or curve, it will only make marks at each point.  

\item "smooth" means the plot will make a smooth curve through the
  points (where the points are either given in a coordinate list, or
  by sampling a function).  

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
