# pgfplots
This repository is to share:
* A short (50 page) tutorial on using pgfplots for graphing Calculus-type functions.
* Also a one page cheatsheet.
It starts with your first graph in pgfplots, and goes through how to size axes, how to change various styles of the graph, how to make parametric plots, considerations of speed, efficiency and precision, etc.

The last page is a one-page cheatsheet with the commands and options I use most often organized as compactly as I could make them.
